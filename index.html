            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project analyzes Boston's BlueBikes bike-sharing system data to understand urban mobility patterns and user behavior. By examining trip data from January 2025, we aim to uncover insights about how different types of users (members vs. casual riders) utilize the system, identify popular routes and stations, and understand temporal patterns in bike usage.</p>
            
            <h3>About the Data</h3>
            <p>The dataset comes from BlueBikes' publicly available system data, containing over 10,000 bike trips from January 2025. Each trip record includes information such as start/end times and locations, user type (member/casual), and trip duration. The data features both categorical (station names, user types) and continuous variables (trip duration, coordinates), making it ideal for diverse analytical approaches.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Usage Patterns</h2>
            <p>Understanding when people use BlueBikes helps optimize system operations and capacity planning.</p>
            
            <div class="visualization-container">
                <div id="hourly-trips"></div>
                <p class="visualization-explanation">
                    This line chart shows the overall hourly distribution of bike trips. The clear peaks during morning and evening rush hours indicate that many users rely on BlueBikes for commuting. The visualization uses a simple line chart design to clearly show temporal patterns, with careful color choices for readability.
                </p>

            <div class="visualization-container">
                <div id="trips-heatmap"></div>
                <p class="visualization-explanation">
                    The heatmap reveals the intensity of bike usage across different days and hours. Darker colors indicate higher trip volumes, helping identify peak usage periods. The design uses a sequential color scheme to effectively show intensity variations.
